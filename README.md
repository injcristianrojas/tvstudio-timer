As part of my classes, podcasts, meetings, etc., I wanted a timer just like
the TV networks use to control broadcast times.

Python 3 supported, and works on GNOME 47. Requires the
[Alarm Clock font](https://www.dafont.com/alarm-clock.font), but you can use
any digital font you want. Only change the font in style.css.

Launch using:

```shell
python timer.py HH:MM
```

Or:

```shell
python timer.py YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS 
```
